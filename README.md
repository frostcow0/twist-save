# twist
A GitHub Repository for the TWIST use case scenario that we're doing in class.
Worked a lot on controllers, saving stuff from forms, populating dropdowns from the database, modifying routes with the controller changes, changing a LOT on the models as our information changed, pretty much ran class meetings. Also, did a fair bit of debugging.
