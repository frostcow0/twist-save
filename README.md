# twist
A GitHub Repository for the TWIST use case scenario that we're doing in class.

Worked a lot on controllers, saving stuff from forms, populating dropdowns from the database, modifying routes with the controller changes, changing a LOT on the models as our information changed, pretty much ran class meetings. Also, did a fair bit of debugging.

The main learning objective of this project was to learn how to work in a group for a client project.

We ran into a lot of problems with the models and constantly changing the names as well as the types of the attributes for the models. This lead to a lot of issues with inconsistencies in names across several files. It taught me to be more thorough on solving problems when they arise. 

We don't have an edit session, a participant list for sessions, or the ability to print schedules. All would be fairly easy to finish in approx. two weeks' time.

If I were to start this project over I would run the pre-dev work better. We lacked a lot of priority because we didn't know what we should start with and what were prerequisites to what.
